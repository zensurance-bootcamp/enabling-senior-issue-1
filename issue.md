# legacy-api localhost:3001/settings Endpoint Returns 500 Error When Running via Docker

When running the `legacy-api` locally using Docker Compose, the `localhost:3001/settings` endpoint consistently returns a `500 Internal Server Error`. This issue does not occur when the application is run directly via `npm run start`, where the endpoint functions as expected.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

Via Docker (Reproduces 500 Error):

Execute `docker compose up -d` in the legacy-api project directory.
Open a web browser or use a tool like cURL to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/settings`.
Expected: Successful retrieval of settings content (HTTP 200).
Actual: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error is returned.

Via npm (Works as Expected):

Execute `npm run start` in the legacy-api project directory.
Open a web browser or use a tool like cURL to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/settings`.
Expected: Successful retrieval of settings content (HTTP 200).
Actual: Settings content is displayed, and no error occurs.

**Impact: Blocks local development and testing of the legacy-api when using the intended Dockerized environment.**

Results Expected:

- Identify the error.
- Explain root cause and suggest correction
- Provide options for mitigation
- Apply changes
